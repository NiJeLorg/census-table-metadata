"""
Extracts table information from the Postgres database, translates it
into something that makes sense for Elasticsearch, and loads it into Elasticsearch.

To use this, open up a tunnel to the API server (assuming you have the SSH key):

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/censusreporter.ec2_key.pem -L 5432:localhost:5432 -L 9200:localhost:9200 ubuntu@censusreporter.org

(Port 5432 is for Postgres and 9200 is for Elasticsearch)

If you need to, install the dependencies for this repo:
    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages census-table-metadata
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run this script to perform the load:

    python extract_metadata_to_elasticsearch.py

You can then test the results by curling directly against the Elasticsearch HTTP search endpoint:

    curl http://localhost:9200/census/tabulation,table,column/_search -d '
    {
        "query": {
            "term": { "column_title": "housing" }
        }
    }
    '
